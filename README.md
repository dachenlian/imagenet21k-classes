# imagenet21k-classes
Mappings between ImageNet21K categories to their WordNet lemmas

[ImageNet21K](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ImageNet21K)

Files are split based on `train`, `val`, and `small_classes` and whether or not each lemma has its [lex_sense](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/senseidx5wn) appended.
